      * StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder except one difference that StringBuffer is thread safe, 
      * i.e., multiple threads can use it without any issue. The thread safety brings a penalty of performance.
      * When to use which one :
      * If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program,
      *  then use String class object because a String object is immutable.
      *  
      *  If a string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) 
      *  and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
      *  
      *  If a string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads, 
      *  use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.
